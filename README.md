## Overview
### Description
A tool to assist students in calculating their true GPA.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- Category: Education 
- Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer.
- Story: Accepts the input of the user to later determine their GPA.
- Market: Marketed towards students who would like to calculate their GPA.
- Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on whether or not they would like to calculate their GPA.
- Scope: First we would start with accepting user input to calculate their true GPA, then perhaps this could evolve into an application that can be used throughout all establishments.
